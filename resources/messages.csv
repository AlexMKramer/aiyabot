See the picture on your screen, do you know where you have been?
Do a barrel roll!
Eekum-Bokum
It's tail time!
It's dangerous to go alone, take this
Listen!
You have died of dysentery
The enemy's gate is down
You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?
Remember, no Russian.
The cake is a lie
It's time to split!
I can't let you do that, Starfox!
So long and thanks for all the fish
Tis but a scratch!
So long gay Bowser!
Reminds me of Halloween at rip Taylor's
Smashing
Move it football head!
Oh no, he's hot!
As you wish
We may be stupid, but we're also dumb
Bite my crunchy brown ass!
I'll take care of that bomb for ya
Man who go to bed with itchy butt wake up with stinky finger
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just cause some watery tart threw a sword at you
